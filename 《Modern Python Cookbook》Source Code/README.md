#Modern Python Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Modern Python Cookbook](Current URL?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786469250), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
    if distance is None:
        distance = rate * time
    elif rate is None:
        rate = distance / time
    elif time is None:
        time = distance / rate
```

All you need to follow through the examples in this book is a computer running any recent version of Python. While the examples all use Python 3, they can be adapted to work with Python 2 only a few changes.
